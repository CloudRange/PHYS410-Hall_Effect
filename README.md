# Hall Effect
This repository contains the data analysis tools
for the Hall effect experiment for PHYS409 -- Experimental Physics.

It contains three main `.py` files:
1. `dframe_creation.py`
	- Script that compiles several `.dat` files into one `.csv` file.
2. `dframe_iv.py`
	- Same as above but for the "Single current and single voltage" mode.
3. `resistivity.py`
	- Script to measure resistivity.
